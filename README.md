# Typing-Speed-Test App
This is a simple app that allows you to check your typing speed in a minute. It offers a randomly generated set of 30 words which you have to type out. It uses a text file of the common English words.

The text box is present below the "Write below:" sign. This is where you will type your response. This app will keep track of the seconds, your words per minute(WPM), net words per minute (Net WPM)and characters per minute(CPM). The scoreboard at the top will get updated as you type.
### Spelling Check
As you type your response, if you get the character of the word correct, the character will change its color to green:

![correct](https://github.com/samriddhinechali1/typing-speed-test/assets/120707106/d5dcee42-ee63-4b2d-b426-f0f321ee361a)
If you make an error and get a character wrong, the incorrect character will be shown in red:
